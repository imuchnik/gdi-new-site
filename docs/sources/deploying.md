## Deploying to Heroku

If you are an owner and/or have been approved by one of the [Project Leads](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-new-site/blob/production/CONTRIBUTORS.md#project-leads), than this section is relevant to you!

1. Be sure that have the [Heroku tool belt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.
2. Add a remote to the GDI Heroku instance with `heroku git:remote -a girl-develop-it`.
3. Now deploy to Heroku with `git push heroku production`.

**NOTE:** This process will be updated as we start incorporating continuous integration processes, as well as after the site goes officially live.
