## Installation (Website)

Here are some requirements and guides to contributing to the Girl Develop It website code base. Be sure to review this when trying to install a local development environment! Be sure to reach out to us at [website@girldevelopit.com](mailto:website@girldevelopit.com) with questions.


### Required installations
* [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager for Mac OS X.
* [rvm](http://rvm.io/), a command-line tool to manage different versions of Ruby.
* ruby 2.1.7
* PostgreSQL 9.3.+
  * Install with homebrew using `brew install postgres` and follow the brew instructions for these with `brew update` and `brew doctor`. 
  * **OR**
  * Using [Postgres.app for Mac OS X](http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/) (recommended).

**Note:** If you are upgrading from 9.2., please see instructions below for "Upgrading PostgreSQL from 9.2."

### Setting up your local dev environment

- Fork this repo into your personal Github account.
- Clone _your_ copy to your desktop, then navigate to that directory.
- Next, install all required gems:

```sh
bundle install
```

- If you run into an error `-bash: bundle: command not found`, install the `bundle` gem, then try again.
```sh
gem install bundle; bundle install
```

- Next, start postgres with command-line interface OR with PostgreSQL Mac OS X GUI. Make sure it is running before proceeding to next steps.

Finally, set up the database:

```sh
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

This will build your database and populate it with some test data. If you are setting up a local development environment, ignore rake migration errors for now. Optionally instead of the `rake` command, you can simply run

```sh
createdb
```

- Meetup API key is set as an environment variable. To register a [new API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/).

To run locally:
```
$ export MEETUP_API_KEY=[new key]
```

Check with
```
$ echo $MEETUP_API_KEY
```

- Add another remote:  
   `git remote add upstream git@github.com:girldevelopit/gdi-new-site.git`
- Now test your local dev environment by running `rails s` and visiting http://0.0.0.0:3000. You should now see a local copy of the live website! \o/

### Ubuntu installation instructions
* Install RVM [Website Instructions](http://rvm.io/rvm/install)
  * Install the pgp key for rvm
  ```sh
  gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys D39DC0E3
  ```
  * Install rvm, make sure to not run this as sudo, RVM should be installed on your user
  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
  ```
  * Source the RVM scripts (the output from the install command has instructions for how to set this up permanently)
  ```sh
  source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
  ``` 
* Install Ruby

rvm install 2.1.7
```
* Create a new Gemset
```sh
